                    The morning began with a tired body, I might have slept on the wrong side of the bed. Then I prepared and went to school.
                    Classes ended, then I went home.
                    The day was a normal day for me, a student.

                    The morning began again with a tired body, I might really need to change the bed but I didn't have the time, I had to go to school. 
                    The classes started with a lecture then a quiz in the afternoon.
                    Then classes ended, went home, change clothes then I layed down in my bed.
                    I did not think of anything, I just went to sleep.
